# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
experience = Experience.create({ name: 'U47 Cardioid' })
experience = Experience.create({ name: 'U47 Polar' })
experience = Experience.create({ name: 'U47 Close-Up' })
